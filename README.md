# Protobuf JVM Consumer Example

This example demonstrate using the prototype Protobuf plugin to support matching Protobuf messages.

The [proto file](../../../proto/plugin.proto) for the plugin interface is used for these tests.

The consumer has two tests, one for the simple InitPluginResponse message and one for the more complex
InteractionResponse message.

## Running the consumer tests

Before the consumer tests can be run, the Protobuf plugin needs to be built and installed into `$HOME/.pact/plugins`.
See [the plugins docs](../../../plugins/protobuf/README.md) for instructions.

The tests are run using Gradle, so just run `./gradlew check` and if the tests pass, a pact file will be 
created in the `build/pacts` directory.
